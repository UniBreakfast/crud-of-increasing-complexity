# CRUD implementations of gradually increasing complexity

## What is this?

This is a collection of progressively more complex CRUD implementations. There are countless directions to go from the simplest implementation. I will try to explore some of them. I will try to keep the implementations as simple as possible, adding only one or two new concepts at a time. The simplest one for me is in the [`0000-simplest-for-me`](0000-simplest-for-me) directory.

## What is CRUD?

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It's a set of operations that are usually performed on data. It's a common set of operations for databases, but it can be used for any kind of data.
