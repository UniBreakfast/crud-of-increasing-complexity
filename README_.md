# [CRUD implementations of gradually increasing complexity](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/crud-of-increasing-complexity)

## What is this?

This is a collection of progressively more complex CRUD implementations. There are countless directions to go from the simplest implementation. I will try to explore some of them. I will try to keep the implementations as simple as possible, adding only one or two new concepts at a time. The simplest one for me is in the [`0000-simplest-for-me`](0000-simplest-for-me/README.md) directory. From it this repository is supposed to grow like a tree. Every folder is a node or a fork in its branches. Every folder has a README.md file with a description of the implementation and a link to the next one or, hopefully, more then one. Each of those will add some feature or two to the previous implementation it is based on. The goal is to explore the space of CRUD implementations.

## What is CRUD?

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It's a set of operations that are usually performed on data. It's a common set of operations for databases, but it can be used for any kind of data.
